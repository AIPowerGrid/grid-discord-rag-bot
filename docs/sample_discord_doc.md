# Discord Bot Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides information about the Discord project and how to use the Discord API to build bots.

## Getting Started

### Discord Developer Portal

To create a Discord bot, you need to register your application in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot"
4. Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token
5. Use this token in your application's configuration

### Basic Bot Setup

Here's a basic example of setting up a Discord bot using discord.py:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Set up the bot with command prefix
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Bot is ready. Logged in as {bot.user}')

@bot.command()
async def hello(ctx):
    await ctx.send('Hello, Discord world!')

# Run the bot with your token
bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

## Bot Commands

Discord bots can respond to various commands. Here are some examples:

### Basic Commands

- `!help` - Shows help information
- `!info` - Provides information about the bot
- `!ping` - Checks if the bot is responsive

### Advanced Commands

You can create more complex commands that take arguments:

```python
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, *, message):
    await ctx.send(message)

@bot.command()
async def add(ctx, a: int, b: int):
    await ctx.send(f'The sum is: {a + b}')
```

## Event Handling

Discord bots can react to various events:

```python
@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == bot.user:
        return
    
    if 'hello' in message.content.lower():
        await message.channel.send('Hello there!')
    
    await bot.process_commands(message)

@bot.event
async def on_member_join(member):
    channel = member.guild.system_channel
    if channel is not None:
        await channel.send(f'Welcome {member.mention} to the server!')
```

## Permissions

Discord bots have different permission levels:

- **User-level permissions**: Regular commands any user can use
- **Moderator-level permissions**: Commands for server moderators
- **Administrator-level permissions**: Commands for server administrators
- **Bot owner permissions**: Commands only the bot owner can use

## Deployment

When deploying your Discord bot, consider:

1. Hosting options (VPS, PaaS, etc.)
2. 24/7 uptime
3. Error handling and logging
4. Performance monitoring
